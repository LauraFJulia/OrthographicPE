mainPoseEstimation.m          - do I/O and call OrthographicPoseEstimation
example.m                     - example script


Setup and Usage
---------------

MATLAB
------
1. You must have MATLAB software installed on your computer.
2. The following toolbox is required:
  * optimization_toolbox
3. Run the example script example.m to easily use the code. It contains all the necessary steps for the pose estimation of three perspective views using the orthographic model. The data used as example is in the data/ folder.

OCTAVE
------
1. You must have GNU Octave installed on you computer. You can install it in Ubuntu systems running the following command:

 sudo apt-get install octave octave-optim

2. Run the example script example.m.
