function space_points=triangulation3D(Pcam,image_points)
%TRIANGULATION3D Triangulation of N 3D points from their image points in M>1 images.
%
%  The triangulation is computed by the DLT algorithm.
%
%  Input arguments:
%  Pcam         - M-cell of projection 3x4-matrices
%  image_points - 2MxN or 3MxN matrix containing the image points for each
%                 camera if they are known or NaN otherwise. Both cartesian
%                 and homogeneous coordinates are accepted.
%
%  Output arguments:
%  space_points - 4xN-array containing the 3d estimated positions (in
%                 homogeneous coordinates) of the image points.
